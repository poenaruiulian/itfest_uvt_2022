# I'm here

---
Because making sure that everyone at the course is there is hard we brought you "I'm here". A React Native application that combines social fun with the attendace list.

---

The user is welcomed with a start page, where he can choose to Login or Register:

<img src="./readmeImages/start.jpg" width="288" height="512">

Than the user input:

<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/login.jpg" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/register.jpg" width="288" height="512">
<div>

  
After that the student is sent to the courses on that day:
  
<img src="./readmeImages/courses.jpg" width="288" height="512">

  
And every link has the attendace list under the form of a social app:
  
<img src="./readmeImages/feed.jpg" width="288" height="512">

  
The student can take his photo:
  
<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/transition.jpg" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/camera.jpg" width="288" height="512">
<div>
